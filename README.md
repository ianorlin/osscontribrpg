=============

A boring random text based game where you try not to go crazy being an open source contributor.  Right now the four contributions are IRC, Documentation, QA, and DEV. I may add more. Also right now only console input is supported. This game is written in C++.

The game is not currently finished as in only in a barely playable state. I have plans for allowing to have differnt names for differnt players and a local multiplayer mode. There is also the start of a custom game mode where you can set different levels for victory expirence you already have and stress tolerence. 

Information on playing the game. RIght now it is only turn based and takes input from console at each round. I may decide to port to a GUI if I want to later. In each round you enter a key to choose how to contribute or any other key to rest. 

Note that you can still level up and gain stress the chance of the two is statisicaly independent if you chose to contribute and resting is the only way to reduce stress. If you reach the level where you win and go crazy in a round of the game  you still are crazy. You cannot rest and gain stress however. 
 
For the default game you want to reach level 10 in a contribution without getting to 6 stress. There currently is not a time limit althuogh this could be a future feature.
