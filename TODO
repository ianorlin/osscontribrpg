1. Add custom game mode where you can choose what level you declare victory and stress tolerence. 
     a. get user input for this custom game. Done and is working 
     b. allow user to chose default game which uses default constructor or custom game which uses constructor with paramaters Done consturctor implemented 
.     i. have function that allows user to implement custom game returning a bool. Not a function but just a branch in main for choosing custom game and then use turn for the single player.
c. maybe allow users to enter their name if they want to using a named player class. This wouldn't make much sense for defualt game though.  
2 Add multiplayer mode where it alternates between players.
a. to do this having names for the players would be nice maybe use inheritance with Player as the base class.
b.  if multiplayer and custom game are both possible modes than the custom things should be same for each player otherwise is very unbalanced. want defualt game multiplayer first so later. 
c. I want multiplayer to be player one decides  on contribution then Player 2 Then a Player 3 if there is one can do it.
d. Implement all the different players as lists and use iterators to move to next player for each turn. 
e.
