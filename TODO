1. Add custom game mode where you can choose what level you declare victory and stress tolerence. 
     a. get user input for this custom game. 
     b. allow user to chose default game which uses default constructor or custom game which uses constructor with paramaters
.     i. have function that allows user to implement custom game returning a bool. 
2? Add multiplayer mode where it alternates between players.
a. to do this having names for the players would be nice maybe use inheritance with Player as the base class.
b.  if multiplayer and custom game are both possible modes than the custom things should be same for each player otherwise is very unbalanced.
